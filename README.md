Our game can be played on `Pythons_Wild_Ride[USE ME].py`

The main chunk of the code framework is done in `Project1SourceClasses.py` while the
prototyping of game flow is done in `project1_prototyping.ipynb` 

basic unit testing is within file as well (for Lab 6)

JSON files were made for persistence and charcter/enemy creation
